# CS-300 DSA: Analysis and Design

## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

I developed pseudocode for the Computer Science department at ABCU, addressing advising requirements for various data structures, including vectors, hash tables, and trees. After completing a Big O analysis, I wrote code for a second project, enabling department advisors to utilize the application for reading course data files, sorting and printing courses, and accessing course information.

## How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached the problem by analyzing each data structure (vector, hash table, and tree), comparing the advantages and disadvantages of each structure in my evaluation. Then, I made a recommendation for which data structure to use in my code and provided justification for my recommendation, based on the Big O analysis results and my analysis of the three data structures.

## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I overcame any roadblocks by referring to the course material and seeking assistance on Stack Overflow whenever I faced challenges.

## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

My approach to designing software and developing programs has improved through working on these projects where I demonstrated mastery of the following competencies: applying non-coding development methodologies to outline algorithmic designs, evaluating complex data structures to solve given problems using advanced algorithmic designs, and developing code using algorithms and data structures to address basic programming problems.

## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

My work on this project, especially during the design phase where I wrote pseudocode, has changed how I write programs. I now fully understand the need to weigh all options and analyze requirements to make informed decisions, ensuring the program is highly maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
